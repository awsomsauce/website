# Moving towards Cloud 


As they say "Change is the only constant", and this applies aptly to the most volatile and ever changing world of Information Technology. Only around 80 years ago Mr. Allan Turing was given an assignment of decoding the messages that flowed from the German Military Head Quarters to their troops and he developed a mechanism using a large magnetic tape systems to decode them and where are we today. Today we are surrounded only by gadgets, applications, websites all around. We start our day by opening the phone to check messages and mails in the morning and end it with some entertainment videos at night. We try to manage all our daily stuff using these applications and gadgets. In a way our lifestyle has become highly dependent on these systems. In the lockdown that dependence has again increased exponentially, as from our meetings to ordering our groceries and food everything is being managed by these applications. 
Even if the applications goes down for a short span of time there is a big problem all around the world. A big panic sets in. The recent [whatsapp](https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/whatsapp-and-instagram-down-for-thousands-of-users-11616175831566.html) and [Google services](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/14/google-suffers-worldwide-outage-with-gmail-youtube-and-other-services-down) outage was a great example.

What I have always wondered in last few years is that how the world has come so far where everything is going towards digitization? How are these applications that have made us so dependent on them so resilient? How do they serve millions of users worldwide at a given point of time? How and where such a large amount of data stored and processed? How do our handheld devices like smart-phones, smart TVs or laptops that have very limited amount of resources can serve us with all these services? 

The answer to all the above question is "Cloud" and "Cloud Applications". The term has had a lot of chatter going about it, a lot of people have tried to use it for [humour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnxrJiS5uKU&t=131s). But what actually is the defination of "Cloud" and "Cloud Applications"?
I can sum up cloud applications in following four points:

- Any application that can serve millions of users and works on the internet. The applications work in a way that 
- Users have only an interface to request a service.
- Data Processing, business logic execution, data storage, user preferences, all the infrastructure intensive activities are done on remote machines. 
- The users are only provided only what they request.

If we talk about the [etymology](https://www.cnbc.com/id/43483060#:~:text=The%20concept%20of%20cloud%20computing,computing%20power%2C%20applications%20and%20files) of cloud its very humourous and fascinating. "The concept of cloud computing dates to the 1960s. The phrase originates from the cloud symbol used by flow charts and diagrams to symbolize the Internet. The diagram to the left underscores the idea that any Web-connected computer has access to a pool of computing power, applications and files".

So let us talk about the cloud in depth. As we have discussed earlier the processing, storage, business logic execution etc. is done on remote machines. This seems to be a fairly easy concept but it is not that simple. To understand we will look at three different types of services that constitute together to get us what cloud is.

1. Software as a Service(SaaS): Most of the services that we use daily on our phones and laptops fall under this category. SaaS applications are also known as on-demand software and Web-based/Web-hosted software. The applications that follow a licensing based or subscription based delivery of services that are accessed by the consumers using thin clients like web browsers or smart-phone applications fall essentially under this category. If we think of it in case of NetFlix we only fire a request to the application like "Serve me with an awesome experience of the movie let's say The Dark Knight". Your phone or your web browser in no time starts streaming the movie for you, you do not have movie stored on your phone, you  do not have the catalogue, nothing is done on your phone except a platform that can run video content.
2. Platform as a Service(PaaS): PaaS sometimes becomes very confusing to understand as it is very close to the IaaS. I will try my best to make the difference as clearer as I can. Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud. It has resources that enable the users/developers to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. Developers can purchase the resources needed from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection. Seems very much like IaaS (we will talk about it in next section). The most significant distinction is that the PaaS service provides much more than just the infrastructure. It provides the complete environment for which development and deployment is required. PaaS allows developers to avoid the expenses  of buying and managing software licenses, the underlying application infrastructure and middleware, container orchestrators such as Kubernetes or the development tools and other resources required by the application. Examples of PaaS are Microsoft Azure Platform, SAP Cloud, Google App Engine.
3. Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS): IaaS refers to the service where the developers are provided with the infrastructural needs on demand. Here only infrastructure is managed by the cloud provider, everything else needs to be taken care by the user. Prominent examples will be AWS EC2, Google Cloud etc.

This image tries to explain the major bifurcation between each of the service.

With this I would leave you to explore more on these services and in the next article of the series we will discuss in depth about developing the cloud based applications, its approach and other related details.
